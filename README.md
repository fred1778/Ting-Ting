# Ting-Ting
Ting Ting was a simple typewriter themed letter game for iOS I developed in 2014/15, which I released on the App Store in Feburary 2015. It was the first piece of software I created. 

This repo serves as an archive for the Objective-C source code (Ting Ting was developed just before Swift came about).  My first experience with programming was with Objective-C, back in 2011 when, enamoured with my new iPad 2, I wanted to learn how to make iOS apps, and ended up working my way through Objective C for Dummies. It was not the most beginner-friendly language to learn how to code with! I ended up learning about pointers and encapsulation before I could really code anything...
On and off over the next few years, I tinkered with iOS development in this language, until in the summer of 2014, before I left for University, I just swereved off-piste from an online tutorial and muddled my way to a coherent albeit very simple letter app - Ting Ting. I recorded the 'ting' sounds from my grandfather's old Olympia typewriter, whilst the graphics were just screenshots of shapes I made in Pages (a word processor!), edited with Preview! I polished it up in Febuary 2015, submitted it to the App Store, where it languered for years before Apple removed it as it hadn't been updated for ages and didn't have many downloads :(
